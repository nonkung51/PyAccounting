# PyAccounting
Python module for accounting with the most awesome license ever.

Literally, I have nothing to say.

You don't even need to care about the license! Use it what ever you like!

Just copy the pyaccounting.py to folder of your project.

type 
```
"import pyaccounting" 
```
or 
```
"from pyaccounting import account" 
```
and you're all set!
